Topics to prepare:

1. Coding
  - Leet code (Easy and medium) [don't worry too much about test cases]
  - Code some algorithms from scratch (binary search, BFS/DFS, Quick/merge sort)
  - Practice statistical coding in python - generating random numbers, bivariate normals etc
2. Machine learning:
    - Simple derivations of logistic regression, SVM etc
    - Assumptions of linear regression
    - Practice: Decision theory notes, Andrew Ngâ€™s lectures
    - Python [cookbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html)
    - Read elements of statistical learning book
- Deep learning:
    - Why RNN/LSTM?
    - Structure of an LSTM
    - Do Neuromatch tutorials
