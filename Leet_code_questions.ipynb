    "* Minimum Domino Rotations for Equal Row: [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-domino-rotations-for-equal-row/)\n",
    "**Hint**: For rotations to be possible, the most common element of each row should occur in the other row wherever it does not occur in the current row\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maximum Points you can obtain from cards [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-you-can-obtain-from-cards/)\n",
    "**Hint**: The order does not matter. See if any combination of leftmost and right most arrays gives you a higher sum than just k elements from one end\n",
    "\n",
    "* Validate whether a stack is a valid push and pop [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-stack-sequences/submissions/)\n",
    "**Hint**: For each $pop_{rev}$, check if the element is the first to be pushed. If not, put it in a stack and check if it is the next one. Finally, check if the stack is empty\n",
    "\n",
    "* Schedule given tasks in such a way that there is a minimum specified idle time between two repeated tasks [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/)\n",
    "**Hint**: Choose a greedy approach where you sort the tasks by their frequency and choose them in the order of their frequency. For each repeat the idle time required is decreased"
