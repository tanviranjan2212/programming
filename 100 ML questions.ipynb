    "1. What are the assumptions required for linear regression? What if some of these assumptions are violated?\n",
    "\n",
    "4 assumptions, \n",
    "* linear relation b/w x,y\n",
    "* for any fixed value of x, y is normally distributed\n",
    "* observations are independent\n",
    "* for any value of x, the variance of the residual is the same\n",
    "\n",
    "Extreme violations will make results wrong, small violations will result in greater bias or greater variance\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is collinearity? What is multicollinearity? How do you deal with it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Collinearity: Predictors are not independent of each other. For observations, we can do PCA to identify independent dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Blog ans: Use Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to determine if there is collinearity between observations. As a benchmark, VIF>5 => collinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "From Wikipedia, $VIF = \\frac{1}{1-R_j^2}$ where $R_j$ is the $R^2$ of regressing one predictor $X_j$ onto the other predictors $X_{-j}$. Higher $R_j^2$ suggests higher VIF\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why is Naive Bayes “naive”?\n",
    "It assumes that features are independent of one another, which is not always the case\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are random forests? When is Naive Bayes better?\n",
    "Random Forest consists of making many decision trees by first bootstrapping the data and then selecting a subset of features"

    "1. You are at a Casino and have two dices to play with. You win 10dollar every time you roll a five. If you play till you win and then stop, what is the expected payout?\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability of you winning a chance is $\\frac{4}{36} = \\frac{1}{9}$. That means you'll win once in 9 chances. Let's say it costs $C$ dollars for every play, so you pay $9 \\times C$, and you only win 10dollars at the end. Expected payout = $9C - 10$, so it must cost very little (~1dollar) for the game to be fun to anyone\n",

    "If you roll a die twice and consider the event of two rolls, there are 36 different outcomes. If we exclude the combination (6,6), there will be 35 possible outcomes. You can then assign 5 combinations to each number from 1 to 7\n",
