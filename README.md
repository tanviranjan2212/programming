# Preparing for interviews

I am currently preparing for interviews in the roles of Data Scientist, Research Scientist, Applied Scientist or Machine Learning engineers. 

This folder is a collection of practice materials - contents range from LeetCode practice to ML techniques derivation and more.

Although I am making this for myself, I hope someone else can find this useful
